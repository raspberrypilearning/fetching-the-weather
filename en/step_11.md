- You could have a look at some weather data from other locations in the world. Use the web to find some longitudes and latitudes of other places, and then fetch weather from their nearest stations.

- How about importing the data from several Weather Stations into some spreadsheet software and drawing some graphs? Or maybe you'd like to try and use Python to draw some graphs for you?
