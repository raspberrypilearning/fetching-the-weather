## What you will make
This resource teaches you how to access the Raspberry Pi Weather Station database using a RESTful API, how to use the haversine formula to calculate which weather station is closest to you, and how to fetch the latest weather data from that station.

## What you will learn
By creating a script to fetch data from a weather database, you will learn:

- How to access a RESTful API in Python
- How to convert JSON data into dictionaries
- How to pretty-print data
- How to calculate distances between two points on the Earth's surface
